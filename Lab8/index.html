	Welcome and Thanks! I have added hints, buggy code and then final solutions.
	I highly recommend you to only see hints, try and then look at the solution. I have
	purposly made many mistakes in the code, and that's your job to fix those problems. 
	Also Please, don't just copy and paste because then my all time and work that I put here will be
	wasted, so try to understand and ask questions over and over again.

		Hint: Everyone finished this part in lab. So I'm not giving any specific hints, but 
		if you don't remeber the answers then just copy and paste the code and run to get the

		Problem1 : Read a string of 1's and 0's. Count numbers of successive 1's and number of successive 0's, until the end. <br>[Using 3 while loops, but can we do better? ]
	</span><br>
	<img src="../pics/Lab8/1sol1.png"><br>
	<div class="question">[Well here's a solution with 2 while loops, can we do even better?]</div>

	<div class="problem">
	<span class="question">
		Problem2 (a) : Write a function that takes a lowercase character ch and a positive integer n as two arguments and return a string of n consecutive characters that begins with character ch. Wrap-around when applicable, i.e., consider ‘a’ be the next character to ‘z’
	</span><br>

	<span class="question">
		Problem2 (b) : Write a function that takes an integer myint and a positive integer n as two arguments and return a list of n consecutive integers that begins with myint.

	<div class="problem">
	<span class="question">
		Problem3 (a) :  Without using the find string method, write a function that behaves exactly like the find string method. As your function is not a string method, the string to search must be an argument—let’s make it the first one. The resulting format of your function will be:
		find(some_string, substring, start, end)  <br>[LOOK AT LINE 10, is it correct? ]

	</span><br>
	<div class="question">[Hmmm, basic outline should be something like this?]</div>
	<img src="../pics/Lab8/3asol1.png"><br>
	<div class="question">[Let's try to understand it]</div>
	<img src="../pics/Lab8/3asol2.png"><br>
	<div class="question">[Something is still worng?? what is it? LINE 10 may be?]</div>
	<img src="../pics/Lab8/3asol3.png"><br>


	</div>


	<div class="problem">
	<span class="question">
		Problem3 (b) : Write a function named multi_find(some_string, substring, start, end)
that, instead of returning one integer index, returns a list that contains zero or more indices
	</span><br>

	<div class="question">[Here's an explanation for you! read everything!]</div>

	<img src="../pics/Lab8/3bsol1.png"><br>

	<div class="question">[Finish previous parts and then look below, it's the final solution for both part a and b, look at line 10. Please look at this once you have tried everything!!]</div>

	<img src="../pics/Lab8/3sol1.png"><br>
	</div>

	<div class="problem">
	<span class="question">
		Problem3 (c) : Write a program that exercises both your find and your multi_find functions. Create some strings using only the base letters, ATCG, and search for substrings within them.

	</span><br>

	<div class="question">[I'm leaving this one to you guys, try and if you can't solve it then email me. I'll add some possible solutions here! Thanks!]</div>
