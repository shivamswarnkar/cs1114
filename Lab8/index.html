		Problem2 (a) : Write a function that takes a lowercase character ch and a positive integer n as two arguments and return a string of n consecutive characters that begins with character ch. Wrap-around when applicable, i.e., consider ‘a’ be the next character to ‘z’

	<div class="problem">
	<span class="question">
		Problem3 (a) :  Without using the find string method, write a function that behaves exactly like the find string method. As your function is not a string method, the string to search must be an argument—let’s make it the first one. The resulting format of your function will be:
		find(some_string, substring, start, end)

	<div class="problem">
	<span class="question">
		Problem3 (b) : Write a function named multi_find(some_string, substring, start, end)
that, instead of returning one integer index, returns a list that contains zero or more indices
